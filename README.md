# nightgraphix

This was my first "big" software project. At the age of 15. Yay, Visual Basic 6 ftw! :blush:

But hey:
* custom graphics rendering with own fifo buffer
* custom "text editor" â€” render the caret and all letters in any available font/size
* zooming and scrolling with the mouse wheel
* custom file format for saving the project
* custom protocol to send the data to the microcontroller in the RC helicopter
* image import
